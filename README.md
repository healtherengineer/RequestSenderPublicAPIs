# RequestSenderPublicAPIs
First of all I designed backend and I picked a public API called "https://coffee.alexflipnote.dev/random.json" which returns coffee images. Then I used Javascript and Html for frontend of this workspace. 
When you click the Execute button it returns new image about coffee , example below :)
